        Second: The orthographical symbols are twentyfive in number. 1 This finding made it possible, three 
        hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem 
        which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which
         my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninetyfour was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated 
         from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, 
         but the nextthy pyramids. tolast page says Oh ti me This much is already known: for every sensible line of 
         straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. 
         (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitio us custom of finding a 
         meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's 
         palm ... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twentynatural symbols, but maintain that 
         this applicat five ion is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall 
         see, is not entirely fallacious.
