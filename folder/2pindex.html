        Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of 
        catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparin g to die just a few leagues from the hexagon 
        in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be 
        the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generat ed by the fall, which is infinite. 
        I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, 
        at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconcei vable. (The mystics claim 
        that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which 
        follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cycli cal book is God.) 
        Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons 
        and whose circumference is inaccessible.
