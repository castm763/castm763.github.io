        There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each sh elf contains thirtyfive books of uniform format; 
        each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are 
        black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indi cate or prefigure what 
        the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose 
        discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axio ms.
