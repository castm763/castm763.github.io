    <element class="blackout"> elected officials and community leaders gathered outside of the Sikh Cultural 
    Society in Richmond Hill on Sunday, April 10, to denounce the unprovoked attack against 
    a 70-year-old member of the Sikh community. State Assembly members Jenifer Rajkumar and 
    David Weprin were joined by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, Congresswoman 
    Grace Meng, former City Councilwoman Liz Crowley and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer 
    for a press conference outside of the Sikh Cultural Society, located at 95-30 118th St. 
    The lawmakers expressed</element> sympathy <element class="blackout">to Singh’s family and the Sikh community at large. “The 
    Sikh community has endured targeted discrimination for many years, and the attack on Mr. 
    Singh is a reminder that we need to act to ensure</element> justice and security <element class="blackout">in our communities,” 
    said Weprin, who also thanked the bystander who witnessed the attack and called the authorities. 
    “An attack on the Sikh community is an attack on all of us. Hate</element> will never have a home in Queens,
     or anywhere else in this city or state of New York<element class="blackout">.” The community gathering comes a week after 
     the victim, Nirmal Singh, was attacked from behind while taking an early morning walk on April 3. 
     Singh was walking to the Sikh Cultural Society nearby when a man approached him and punched him 
     in the nose, causing him to fall to the ground, according to authorities. Following the incident, 
     Singh suffered a fractured nose, a swollen black eye and an injured wrist, community leader Japneet 
     Singh told QNS. Singh was visiting New York on a tourist visa for two weeks. According to community 
     leaders, he has returned to India after his family members were concerned for his safety. Recently, 
     the NYPD has released surveillance video of a man who is suspected of attacking Singh. The suspect is 
     described as an adult man with a dark complexion and an average build. He was last seen wearing 
     black sneakers, jeans and a blue hooded sweatshirt. The investigation is ongoing by the NYPD Hate 
     Crimes Task Force. “The same person that did this walked back in front of our Gurudwara after the 
     incident happened,” Japneet said. “This community is still not safe because this person is not 
     caught. We need drastic measures to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone living in New York 
     state, as well as the rest of the country.” Jatinder Singh Boparai, president of the Sikh Cultural 
     Society, called on elected representatives to protect the community and seek justice for Nirmal.“If 
     people aren’t safe in their home, they are not safe anywhere. We don’t have enough protection 
     and need more patrolling,” Singh said.Jatinder Singh Boparai, president of the Sikh Cultural Society. 
     Gurdev Singh Kang, Human Rights commissioner of New York City, reiterated that there is no place for 
     hate crimes in Queens.“Queens County is diverse with</element> different<element class="blackout"> languages, different religions and 
     colorful people living in this community. JFK Airport is here and our Punjabi </element>people<element class="blackout"> migrated from 
     India when our elders, who don’t speak English and have a language </element> barrier<element class="blackout">, are now scared</element>sitting<element class="blackout">
     in their homes and feel anyone can be victimized,” Kang said. As the first Punjabi American elected 
     to New York State Office, Rajkumar says she has spoken to the NYPD and will do everything in her 
     power to ensure that the perpetrator of the crime is brought to justice. According to Rajkumar, Sikh 
     Americans are among the nation’s most targeted groups. “There has been a 200% rise in hate crimes 
     against Sikh Americans in the past couple of years. Recently, four Sikh Americans were fatally shot 
     in the tragic mass shooting in Indianapolis, and once again, there was an assault here at home, an 
     </element>attack<element class="blackout"> against Mr. Singh,” Rajkumar said. “All of New York stands in solidarity with my uncle, Nirmal 
     Singh. An attack  </element>on<element class="blackout"> him is like an attack on my own family. It is an attack on </element>all of us<element class="blackout">. The America 
     we left India for, is an America built on bridges of </element>love, not hate<element class="blackout">.”</element>
